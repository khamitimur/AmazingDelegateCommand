# AmazingTargetCommand

`AmazingTargetCommand` is a spin on classic [`Command`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_pattern) design pattern with a Swift version of [`Target-Action`](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/General/Conceptual/Devpedia-CocoaApp/TargetAction.html) design pattern on top. Together they will enable you to create commands with ease, without unnecessary repetition and no chances of accidentally creating a retencion cycle.

## Why?

Let's say that you are developing financial application and you have `Command` pattern already applied. And it works fine for global commands like `Transfer` and `Deposit`. But now you want to create a command `Export` that is specific to one of the application's screens. What do you do? You create a class that implements your command protocol. And here is where the problem arise. You just created a separate class for a command that is tightly coupled with one of many screens in the application. That's where `AmazingTargetCommand` comes to rescue.

## Usage

```swift
import AmazingTargetCommand

class ExportViewModel {
    
    var exportCommand: AmazingTargetCommand<ExportViewModel, IndexPath>!
    
    init() {
        exportCommand = AmazingTargetCommand(target: self,
                                             executeAction: ExportViewModel.export,
                                             canExecuteAction: ExportViewModel.canExport)
    }
    
    func export(_ parameter: IndexPath) {
        // ...
    }
    
    func canExport(_ parameter: IndexPath) -> Bool {
        let canExport = true
        
        // ...
        
        return canExport
    }
}


class ExportViewController: UIViewController, UITableViewDelegate {
    
    let viewModel = ExportViewModel()
    
    // ...
    
    func tableView(_ tableView: UITableView, didSelectRowAt indexPath: IndexPath) {
        viewModel.exportCommand.execute(indexPath)
    }
    
    // ...
}
```
